# shopping_cart
Shopping cart is a website project for my database class. The website simulates a 'virtual' stock exchnage where users can buy or sell stocks. Each new user is given $100,000 virtual currency to invest.

## Run
Before running the website, you need to install flask, using
```
pip install flask
```
or
```
pip3 install flask
```

To run the website:
```
make
```
